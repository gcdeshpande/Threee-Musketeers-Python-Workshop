Step-by-Step Implementation:
Step 1: Setting up the environment
Before starting, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can use any Python interpreter or a platform like Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, or any other IDE of your choice.
Step 2: Define the Armstrong checking function
First, we need to create a function that checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number.

def is_armstrong(num):
    """Check if the number is an Armstrong number."""
    # Calculate the number of digits (n) in the number.
    n = len(str(num))
    
    # Calculate the sum of digits raised to the power n.
    total = sum(int(digit) ** n for digit in str(num))
    
    return total == num
