# Step-by-Step Implementation:
## Step 1: Setting up the environment
Before starting, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can use any Python interpreter or a platform like Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, or any other IDE of your choice.

## Step 2: Define the Armstrong checking function
First, we need to create a function that checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number.
```python
def is_armstrong(num):
    """Check if the number is an Armstrong number."""
    # Calculate the number of digits (n) in the number.
    n = len(str(num))
    
    # Calculate the sum of digits raised to the power n.
    total = sum(int(digit) ** n for digit in str(num))
    
    return total == num
```

## Step 3: Create a list of given numbers
The next step is to list down all the numbers mentioned in the puzzle that we need to check.
```python
numbers = [153, 371, 370, 407, 8208, 54748, 92727, 93084, 548834]
```

## Step 4: Analyze the given numbers
We'll iterate through the list of numbers and find which ones are Armstrong numbers.
```python
armstrong_numbers = [num for num in numbers if is_armstrong(num)]
```

## Step 5: Display the results
Print the list of Armstrong numbers we found to help Detective Jordan.
```python
print("Armstrong numbers in the list are:", armstrong_numbers)
```

## Step 6: Check for ZIP and PIN codes
Given the hint that Armstrong numbers can be ZIP/PIN codes, we can further categorize our found Armstrong numbers into ZIP codes and PIN codes.
```python
armstrong_zip_codes = [54748, 92727, 93084]
armstrong_pin_codes = [548834]

zip_codes_found = [num for num in armstrong_numbers if num in armstrong_zip_codes]
pin_codes_found = [num for num in armstrong_numbers if num in armstrong_pin_codes]

print("Armstrong ZIP Codes found:", zip_codes_found)
print("Armstrong PIN Codes found:", pin_codes_found)
```

## Step 7: Run the program
Save your code and run the entire script. This will display the Armstrong numbers from the list and also show which ones are ZIP codes and which are PIN codes.

By following these steps, Detective Jordan will have a categorized list of Armstrong numbers, enabling him to narrow down and predict the next possible targets of "The Mathematician".
