Background: Detective Jordan is on the trail of the notorious thief, "The Mathematician". One day, Jordan finds a secret note left by The Mathematician at the crime scene which says, "The key to my next target is hidden in an Armstrong revelation". A list of numbers is scribbled below: 153, 371, 370, 407, and 8208.

Task: The Mathematician is known to rob places that are somehow connected to numbers he leaves behind. Jordan remembers that The Mathematician is obsessed with Armstrong numbers. Jordan has to find out which numbers from the list are Armstrong numbers to predict the next target.

An Armstrong number (of n digits) is an integer such that the sum of its constituent digits raised to the power of n is equal to the number itself.

Puzzle Solution:
Detective Jordan must find which of the given numbers are Armstrong numbers. Jordan needs to analyze each number: split it into individual digits, raise each digit to the power of n (where n is the number of digits in the number), and sum them. If the sum is equal to the original number, it is an Armstrong number.

Note: Armstrong numbers can be ZIP/PIN codes

Armstrong ZIP Codes: 54748, 92727, 93084
Armstrong PIN Codes: 548834
