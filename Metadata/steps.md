To help Detective Clara with her investigation, we'll use Python's libraries to extract metadata from the documents on the USB drive. The process can be divided into several steps:

# Step-by-Step Guide:
## Set Up Your Environment:

Ensure you have the required libraries installed. For this demonstration, we'll assume the files are PDFs, so you'll need the PyPDF2 library:
```python
pip install PyPDF2
```

## Initialization:
Import the necessary libraries and set up the paths to the documents.
```python
import PyPDF2

documents = ["path/to/document1.pdf", "path/to/document2.pdf", ...]  # Add paths to all suspicious documents.
```

## Metadata Extraction Function:
Define a function that extracts metadata from a given PDF document.
```python
def extract_metadata(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(file)
        metadata = reader.getDocumentInfo()
        return {
            "Author": metadata.author,
            "Last Modified": metadata['/ModDate'],
            "Software Version": metadata['/Producer'],
            "Computer Name": metadata['/Creator']
        }
```

## Examine Metadata:
Iterate over each document, extract its metadata, and display it.
```python
for document in documents:
    metadata = extract_metadata(document)
    print(f"Metadata for {document}:\n")
    for key, value in metadata.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}\n")
    print("-" * 50)
```

## Compare with Suspect List:
Detective Clara can now compare the extracted computer names and authors with her list of suspects. If the Computer Name or Author in the metadata matches any name in her list, that suspect should be further investigated.

## Note
Note:
This demonstration assumes the documents are PDFs. If the documents are of another type (e.g., Word, Excel), you'll need another library appropriate for that file type (like python-docx for Word documents).
Metadata can be manipulated or stripped. The presence of a suspect's name or computer in the metadata doesn't guarantee guilt; it's just one piece of the investigation.
Always ensure you have the proper legal permissions to examine and process the data.
