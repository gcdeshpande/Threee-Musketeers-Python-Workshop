Detective Clara is investigating a case of corporate espionage. A suspicious USB drive was found at the scene, and it contained several documents that seem to have been extracted from the company's secure servers. Clara needs to find out the original author or the computer where these documents were last edited to trace back the potential inside accomplice. She decided to check the metadata of these files.

The metadata of any file contains:

Author Name
Last Modified Date
Software Version
Computer Name
Clara has a list of suspects and their respective computer names. She believes that by examining the metadata, she can narrow down her list of suspects.

Help Detective Clara in her investigation.
