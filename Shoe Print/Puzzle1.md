Scenario:
A renowned tech CEO's house was broken into. The security footage was wiped, but the intruder left a clear shoe print on the soft ground near a back entrance. The detectives on the case want to determine the weight and height of the intruder to narrow down their list of suspects.

Detectives know that there's a relationship between a person's height and shoe size, and that shoe size can relate to the surface area of the shoe's sole. Using the depth of the shoe print and the estimated surface area of the shoe, they hope to determine the intruder's weight and, subsequently, their approximate height.

Given:

Shoe print depth: 1.8 cm
The relationship between shoe surface area (in cm^2) and a person's height (in cm) is approximately linear and given by: height = 1.5 * area + 100
The formula to calculate pressure is: Pressure (P) = Force (F) / Area (A), where Force is the weight of the person.
Task:

Determine the intruder's approximate weight.
Use the estimated shoe surface area to determine the intruder's approximate height.
