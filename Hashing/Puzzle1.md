Imagine you are a cyber investigator and you are given a case where an anonymous user is suspected of sending threatening messages. The user is clever and knows the basics of hiding digital footprints, so instead of sending the messages directly, the user sends hashes of the messages. The security team managed to intercept the hashes, and now it's your job to decipher the original message.

Given:
You have a list of intercepted hashes and a clue from an informant that the suspect uses simple English sentences, not longer than five words. You suspect the user is using the MD5 hashing algorithm.

Hashes:
- 2347bb0ac593a4d184bb73eeb4a3589a;
- d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e

Tasks:
Identify the original messages behind the hashes.
