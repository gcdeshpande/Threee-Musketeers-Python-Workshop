To solve this puzzle, you'd need to perform a dictionary or brute-force attack on the intercepted hashes using possible English sentences. Here's a step-by-step plan in Python to achieve this:

# Initialization:
Start by importing the necessary libraries and defining the list of intercepted hashes.
```python
import hashlib
import itertools

intercepted_hashes = ["2347bb0ac593a4d184bb73eeb4a3589a", "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e"]
```

# Hash Function:
Define a function that takes a message as input and returns its MD5 hash.
```python
def get_md5_hash(message):
    return hashlib.md5(message.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
```

# Dictionary Attack:
To simulate a dictionary attack, first, we need a list of common English words. For simplicity, let's assume we have a small list, but in a real scenario, a comprehensive wordlist would be used. Generate all possible sentences (combinations of words) up to a length of 5 words and hash them. Compare each hash to the intercepted hashes. If a match is found, that combination of words is a potential original message.
```python
wordlist = ["hello", "world", "threat", "stop", "now", "or", "else"]  # Sample wordlist for illustration

def generate_sentences(wordlist, max_length):
    for length in range(1, max_length + 1):
        for sentence in itertools.product(wordlist, repeat=length):
            yield ' '.join(sentence)

decoded_messages = {}

for sentence in generate_sentences(wordlist, 5):
    sentence_hash = get_md5_hash(sentence)
    if sentence_hash in intercepted_hashes:
        decoded_messages[sentence_hash] = sentence
```

# Display the Original Messages:
```python
for h, message in decoded_messages.items():
    print(f"Hash: {h} -> Message: {message}")
```

When you run the above code, any matches between the generated hashes and the intercepted hashes will be displayed as potential original messages.
