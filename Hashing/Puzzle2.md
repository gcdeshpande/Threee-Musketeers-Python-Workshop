Crime Puzzle: The Digital Alibi

Detective Lara is working on a case where a suspect claims to have received an alibi message from his friend on the night of the crime. The message, he claims, says, "Stayed in and watched a movie. Talk tomorrow!". The suspect's phone was seized, but the original message was deleted. The only piece of evidence they have is the hash of the message that the suspect claims to have received. They also have a message recovered from the friend's phone which says, "Stayed in and watched a film. Talk tomorrow!". Detective Lara believes that by comparing the hashes of these two messages, she can determine if the suspect's claim is true or if he altered the content of the original message.

Your task is to help Detective Lara by writing a Python program to compare the hashes of the two messages and determine if they match.
