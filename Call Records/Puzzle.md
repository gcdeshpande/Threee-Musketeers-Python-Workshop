Crime Puzzle: The Mysterious Phone Call

# Background:
Detective Harper has been working on a mysterious disappearance of a young woman named Amelia. Amelia was last seen leaving her office, and her whereabouts after that remain unknown. One key piece of evidence that has surfaced is the record of a phone call she made right before her disappearance. The detectives believe that if they could identify the person she called, they might uncover a significant lead.

Upon collecting phone records, Detective Harper discovers that Amelia made a phone call lasting precisely 3 minutes and 42 seconds at 7:23 PM. The phone number, however, seems to have been masked, making the task of identifying the recipient difficult.

However, they have a list of three prime suspects:

- Marcus, her ex-boyfriend.
- Elena, her colleague.
- Vincent, her neighbor.
Detective Harper managed to get a subpoena for the call records of all three suspects for that evening.

# Suspects' Call Records:

## Marcus

- Received a call at 7:20 PM lasting 2 minutes.
- Made a call at 7:24 PM lasting 3 minutes.
- Received a call at 8:10 PM lasting 5 minutes.

## Elena

- Made a call at 7:15 PM lasting 7 minutes.
- Received a call at 7:23 PM lasting 3 minutes and 42 seconds.
- Made a call at 8:30 PM lasting 4 minutes.

## Vincent

- Received a call at 6:50 PM lasting 15 minutes.
- Made a call at 7:50 PM lasting 10 minutes.

# Task:
Using the phone records, Detective Harper needs to determine which of the suspects Amelia called before her disappearance.

# Puzzle Solution:
The call record that matches the duration and time of Amelia's last call is the one received by Elena at 7:23 PM, lasting 3 minutes and 42 seconds. Therefore, Elena was the last person Amelia called before her mysterious disappearance.
