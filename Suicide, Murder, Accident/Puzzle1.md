In the urban landscape of NeoVille, the skyline was marred by a grim discovery: the lifeless body of John Doe, lying several meters away from the foundation of the Skyline Tower. Detectives need to deduce whether John's fall was an accident, a suicide, or a calculated murder. The crucial pieces of the puzzle are the height from which he fell, how far his body was from the building upon landing, and the estimated launch angle if he was propelled from the building.

Assumptions:
- If John slipped or jumped from the building (like in an accidental fall or suicide), there would be no significant horizontal velocity; he would mostly fall straight down.
- If John was forcibly pushed off the building (as in a murder), he would have an initial horizontal velocity, dependent on the launch angle.
