"A famous detective was called to a crime scene where a robbery had taken place. The detective found a note at the crime scene, which appeared to be a clue. The note read:

12, 12, 6, 18, 8, 12, 4.

The detective, well-versed in probability and statistics, figured out that the numbers were a pattern, not a code, and could point to the date of the next robbery. Can you figure out the pattern and predict the number that comes next in the sequence?"

Hint: Pay attention to the relationship between the numbers and think outside the box. The solution might involve considering another context in which these numbers are relevant.
