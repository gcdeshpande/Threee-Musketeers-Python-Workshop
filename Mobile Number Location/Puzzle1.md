Detective Martin is working on a high-profile kidnapping case. The kidnapper has been demanding a ransom for the release of a renowned celebrity. The police were able to trace the call to a disposable mobile phone. However, they believe the victim tried to send out some subtle hints during the call about their location without alerting the kidnapper.

The victim, during the call, mentioned:

- "The sun sets beautifully here."
- "I wish I had my hiking shoes; this place looks perfect for it."
- "I can hear the distant sound of water."

Using the mobile tower pings and these subtle hints, Detective Martin has narrowed down three potential locations:

- A beach house on the west coast.
- A cabin in the mountain region near a waterfall.
- An urban city center apartment near a fountain.

Apart from the subtle hints given by the victim during the call, the police were able to extract a last known GPS location from the victim's smartphone before it was turned off.

The GPS coordinates retrieved are (34.0522, -118.2437).

With the mobile tower pings, the hints, and these coordinates, Detective Martin has narrowed down three potential locations:

- Beach House on the west coast with coordinates (34.0521, -118.2480).
- Mountain Cabin near a waterfall with coordinates (34.0560, -118.2500).
- Urban City Center Apartment near a fountain with coordinates (34.0500, -118.2400).

Detective Martin needs to determine the most likely location of the victim based on the hints provided.
