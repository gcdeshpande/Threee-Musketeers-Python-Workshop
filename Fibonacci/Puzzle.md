Puzzle: The Fibonacci Heist
Background: Detective Taylor is investigating a series of burglaries committed by a thief known as "Fibo". Fibo leaves behind a small card at each crime scene with a sequence of numbers. The recent card found has the following sequence: 5, 5, 10, 15, 25, 40...

Taylor recognizes that the sequence has a pattern and suspects that Fibo is using it to determine the next burglary date.

Task: Taylor needs to determine the pattern and predict the date of the next burglary.

Puzzle Solution: Taylor quickly recognizes the pattern as a variation of the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is a sum of the two preceding ones but with a twist. It seems like Fibo is using the Fibonacci sequence but added the first two numbers together to get the third and continued the sequence with the addition.

The standard Fibonacci sequence starts:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...

But Fibo's sequence goes:
5, 5, 10, 15, 25, 40...

Taylor suspects that the next number in the sequence (the day Fibo will strike next) can be determined by adding the last two numbers in Fibo's sequence.
