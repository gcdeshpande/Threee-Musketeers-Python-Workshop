To solve this puzzle using Python, follow these steps:

# Initialization
Initialize a list with the starting values of Fibo's sequence.
```python
fibo_sequence = [5, 5]
```

# Sequence Generation
Generate the next numbers in the sequence until you reach the desired length or until you feel confident you've predicted Fibo's next burglary date. We'll find the next 10 numbers as an example:
```python
for i in range(10):
    next_num = fibo_sequence[-1] + fibo_sequence[-2]
    fibo_sequence.append(next_num)
```

# Predict the Next Burglary Date
The next burglary date (assuming each number corresponds to a day) is the last number in the sequence:
```python
next_burglary_date = fibo_sequence[-1]
print(f"The next burglary will occur on day: {next_burglary_date}")
```

By running this code, Detective Taylor will be able to predict the day of Fibo's next burglary based on the pattern.
